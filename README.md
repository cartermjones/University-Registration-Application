# University-Registration-Application
This is a project that mimics a console university registration system. 

## Historical Note
This is one of the first software projects that I picked up once I decided to get back into software development. It had been assigned in a OOP class I had been in, and at the time I just didn't get it. Got discouraged. Dropped out. 

Some years later, I picked it back up again and began to tinker with it. And I found that things clicked that hadn't clicked before. 

There's honestly not much to it, and it's barely functional, but it represents a turning point for me, an "Aha!" that rekindled my love for software development and coding. So, there's that.

Cheers!
